# Menu-assessment
Simple Responsive Front-end task  

THE STACK
* I have used Bootstrap Grid system to quickly build responsive pages along with CSS3 and HTML5.
* As guided to use any JS library/framework to read in the JSON, I used AngularJS on the front end.
* I have used Node.js as the server and lowdb - 'a flat file json db powered by lodash' as the database. So that in further if I want to further edit the menu or add prices/images etc would be easily done and also it doesnt need any server for itself and easy to setup. 



Guidelines to run the App  
0)If node.js is already installed skip this step. Download and install node.js from "https://nodejs.org/en/".  
1) Pull from git hub repository: git@github.com:Nishanth15293/Menu-assessment.git or download Zipped folder :https://github.com/Nishanth15293/Menu-assessment.  
2) Using cmd/gitbash, change directory to Client then download bower package manager(if not already installed) using "npm install -g bower" and then do "bower install" to istall all client side dependencies.  
3) Now, change directory to Server and then do "npm install" to install all server side dependencies.  
4) Now start the server using "node server.js".  
5) Using any web browser(Preferably Google Chrome) go to 'http://localhost:8080/'.  
6) Test for device compatibity using chrome's Toggle Device mode to verify responsiveness among all device sizes.
